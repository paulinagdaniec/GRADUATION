# MyType Font Recommendation System
A content-based recommender system created as means to help answer the following research question: _"How can recommender systems assist aspiring designers in collection, management and selection of fonts that evoke desired feel?"_


## Overview
This repository contains the code technical implementation of MyType, a font recommendation system developed for a Graduation Project 
as a part of Data-Driven Design Master Program at Hu University of Applied Sciences Utrecht.


## Description
MyType is a data-driven font recommendation system that helps users find and manage fonts that support the message and feel they want to convey in their design. 
The system is designed to eliminate the need for users to scroll through thousands of fonts to find the right one.


## Features
- User-friendly interface
- Feels selection for font recommendation
- Visual representation of font categories
- Customizable text input and font style
- Data-driven Feedback loop - font recommendations powered by `avfonts_full9.csv` file and user feedback.
- Storing and reviewing details regarding interacting with the prototype (library)
- Explore Font information 


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Base64
- JSON
- CSV


## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Contact me regarding Google font files or aquire them from Google API.
3. Adjust location of the file in `iteration3.py` file.
4. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run iteration3.py`.
5. Open the provided URL in your web browser to access the font recommendation system.
6. Enter your name and project name.
7. Review the font feels and select a suitable category.
8. Input text you would like to try out.
9. Customize the text and font style preferences.
10. Explore font information and details.

## Project Structure
- `iteration3.py`: Fianl Python script for the Streamlit Dashboard.
- `hi.json`, `searching.json`, `arrow-blue.json`: Lottie animation files used for visual representation.
- `mytypelogo.png`, `sans-serif.png`, `display.png`, `serif.png`, `handwriting.png`, `monospace.png`: Image files used for visual elements.
- `avfonts_full9.csv`: CSV file containing font data.


## This work is a continuation of a font recommender system created for State of the Art Technology.
